This simple program asks the user how many trees they wish to purchase, the height they wish to purchase, and if they want delivery. After the user inputs their response, the screen displays
what looks like a receipt. The name of the company, invoice, number and height of trees purchased, price and delivery charge, and total cost are what appear on the screen.
